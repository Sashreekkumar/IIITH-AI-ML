# IIITH-AI-ML

This repository contains my solutions to assignments, lab notebooks, and selected notes from the **iHub-Data AI/ML Foundation Program** offered by IIIT Hyderabad. The course is part of the iHub-Data initiative under the NM-ICPS (National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems) and focuses on building a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning through both theory and practice.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is structured week-wise, with folders named `week1`, `week2`, `week3`, etc. Each folder may include:
- Lab notebooks for hands-on practice
- My assignment solutions
- Partial notes summarizing key topics discussed in class
- Additional research or mini-projects on specific topics (where applicable)

For some weeks, I've explored certain topics in more depth-this includes writing custom code, creating detailed notes, and building small related projects. References and sources for such additional research will be mentioned in a separate `README.md` file inside the respective week's folder.

This format helps keep the material organized and also reflects my learning journey through the course.
