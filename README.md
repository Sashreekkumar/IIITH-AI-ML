# IIITH-AI-ML

This repository contains my solutions to assignments, lab notebooks, and selected notes from the **iHub-Data AI/ML Foundation Program** offered by IIIT Hyderabad. The course is part of the iHub-Data initiative under the NM-ICPS (National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems) and focuses on building a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning through both theory and practice.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is structured week-wise, with folders named `week1`, `week2`, `week3`, etc. Each folder may include:
- Lab notebooks for hands-on practice
- My assignment solutions
- Partial notes summarizing key topics discussed in class
- Additional research or mini-projects on specific topics (where applicable)

For some weeks, I've explored certain topics in more depth‚Äîthis includes writing custom code, creating detailed notes, and building small related projects. References and sources for such additional research will be mentioned in a separate `README.md` file inside the respective week's folder.

This format helps keep the material organized and also reflects my learning journey through the course.
