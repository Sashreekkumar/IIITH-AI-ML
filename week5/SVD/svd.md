# Eigenfaces Project

This project implements the Eigenfaces algorithm for face recognition using data and concepts from Steven Brunton's **Data-Driven Science & Engineering** book. The approach uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify the most significant features (or "eigenfaces") from a dataset of facial images.

Eigenfaces are essentially the principal components of the face image dataset. They capture the key variations among faces, allowing for efficient dimensionality reduction and robust face recognition.
